Thinking for the game 

DAY 1

create class Room 
    - needs : name
              description
              n"
              s"
              e"
              w_to

create class Player
    - needs : name    
              current Room

create while true loop to keep the game running

create logic that 
    - takes in a user input and decides if its valid 
    - takes in [n] [e] [s] [w]
        - compares the input in lower case to hard coded nesw
        - if .X_to exists in hard coded data
            - sets the X_to value to player.current_room
            - display the discription to the new Room
        - else display that there is no room there


Day 2

create class item
    - needs : name
              description
* This will be the _base class_ for specialized item types to be declared
    later.

need a method to add the item to the room
    - item.append(item)
        return item

add a list to Room using item=None 
                        if item is None:
                            item = []

* Add functionality to the main loop that prints out all the items that are
   visible to the player when they are in that room.
