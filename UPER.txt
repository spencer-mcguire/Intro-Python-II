Thinking for the game 

DAY 1

create class Room 
    - needs : name
              description
              n"
              s"
              e"
              w_to

create class Player
    - needs : name    
              current Room

create while true loop to keep the game running

create logic that 
    - takes in a user input and decides if its valid 
    - takes in [n] [e] [s] [w]
        - compares the input in lower case to hard coded nesw
        - if .X_to exists in hard coded data
            - sets the X_to value to player.current_room
            - display the discription to the new Room
        - else display that there is no room there
